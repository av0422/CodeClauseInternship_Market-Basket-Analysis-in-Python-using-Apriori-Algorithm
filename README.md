# Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm

## Overview

This project demonstrates Market Basket Analysis (MBA) using the Apriori algorithm, a popular technique for identifying associations between items in a transaction dataset. It is widely used in retail, e-commerce, and various industries to discover patterns, improve recommendations, and optimize inventory management.

The Apriori algorithm is implemented in Python to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on transaction data.

## Prerequisites

Following libraries used in this project:

- Pandas
- Numpy 
- Matplotlib
- Apyori
- seaborn

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation & Loading**: Preparing transaction data. The data should be in a tabular format with one row per transaction and columns representing items.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing the data in various ways.

3. **Apriori Algorithm**: Used the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.

4. **Visualization**: Visualized the results using plots, such as scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to better understand the relationships between items.

5. **Interpretation**: Interpreted the generated association rules to gain insights into item relationships and identify actionable patterns.
